 * SoundBankPlayer is a sample-based audio player that uses OpenAL. It employs
 * a "sound bank", which contains a set of samples that each cover one or more
 * notes, allowing you to implement a full instrument with only a few samples.
 * It's like SoundFonts but simpler.
 *
 * The SoundBankPlayer takes care of setting up the Audio Session. You only
 * have to provide the sound samples (in CAF, M4A, or any other supported audio
 * format) and a PLIST file that describes how the samples map to MIDI notes.
 *
 * The sound samples must always be mono. SoundBankPlayer pans the notes to 
 * achieve a stereo effect.

 * whole number of waves in the sample and clip it at the zero crossings. Even 
 * then it's hard to get perfect, so it's better to use really long samples. 
 * If you set loopNotes to YES, then you will need to call noteOff: to quiet a 
 * playing note.
 *
 * For piano notes and other sounds that naturally decay to silence, set this 
 * property to NO. You don't need to call noteOff:, the note will automatically
 * terminate itself when it has played to the end of the sample.
